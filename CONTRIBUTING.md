# Contributing

Thanks for contributing. This CLI is intentionally small and focused.

Guidelines:
- Keep the CLI small and task-focused.
- Avoid feature creep; prefer library-side changes when possible.
- Preserve separation from the library; only use the HTTP API.
- Prefer clarity over complexity.

Process:
- Discuss major changes before starting work.
- Keep pull requests narrow and easy to review.
- Update docs when behavior or flags change.
